# KeyWords:
static analysis, standards, critical system, testing, style, exceptions, quality, security.

# Reliabilty & Saftey: 
In games as an example, java is used in some application where the reliabilty and saftey of the app is very enorm. 

It's very necessary to find bugs on early stages.


# static code analysis 
helps developers identify potential bugs before excuting the code.

# Validation Tools Nowadays:
Different tools are using different techniques such as data flow analysis, control flow analysis, systactic pattern matching, thorem proving, model checking... etc

Some of the tools help detecting potenial bugs and some of them check coding standards and metrics.

# open source tools for Java:
Squale, Sonar, EvalMetrics. 
PMD, JLint, FindBugs, JSC.

FindBug is most commonly used tool for potential bugs.

# JSC:
 is Java static checker.
 uses standard compiler optimization algorithms.

 # Handling exceptions Tools:
 Pitest and ÂµJava

# Researchs from Big companies:
 Google: Thindex, Java dependency and error prone.
 NASA & IBM: CheckThread, RacerX and RELAY.
